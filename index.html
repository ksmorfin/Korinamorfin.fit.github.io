                <h2>Certified Personal Trainer</h2>
            <article>
                <p>I am Korina Morfin, an internationally certified NASM Personal Trainer
                    dedicated to helping clients build strength, confidence, knowledge, and -most importantly-
                    real results at any fitness level. My foundation is smart training: workouts that not only
                    make you sweat, but also respect your process, your technique, and your lifestyle.
                </p>
                <p>I take a science-based, biomechanics-driven approach, designing
                    personalized programs that teach you how to train intelligently, progress safely, and understand how
                    your
                    body moves so you can achieve your goals effectively and sustainably. I do not create generic
                    routines-every plan I design has a purpose and a strategy made specifically for you.
                </p>
                <p>My mission is to guide you step by step so you can discover how strong you
                    can truly become, both physically and mentally. I want you to progress, surprise yourself, maintain
                    your results through healthy habits, and most of all, learn to enjoy the process
                </p>
                <p><strong> Training with me means having a coach who pushes you, corrects
                        you, and supports you through every stage-so you can become a more disciplined, confident, and
                        stronger version of yourself.</strong>
                </p>
